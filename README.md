# WishIT

This web app is a simple implementation of a wish list. It contains basic user registration and authentication, along with multiple security issues. You've been warned.

# Installation

1. Copy the source code into your web server's public HMTL folder.
2. Create a database named "wishit".
3. Run the script wishit.sql in your new "wishit" database to create the table structure.
4. Edit all the PHP file to use the database "root" password when connecting.
5. If you're feeling especially reckless, ucomment lines 69-71 in add.php.
6. If you really, really don't care what happens to your server, uncomment line 83.

Good luck and godspeed!
